## Brief overview
This rule file outlines accessibility standards to be followed for all web development tasks. The primary focus is on ensuring all images have descriptive alt-text.

## Development workflow
- Before marking any task as complete, verify that all `<img>` elements have a descriptive `alt` attribute.
- The `alt` text should accurately describe the content and function of the image.
- For purely decorative images that do not convey information, use an empty `alt` attribute (e.g., `alt=""`).

## Task completion criteria
- A task involving the addition or modification of images will not be considered complete until all relevant images have appropriate alt-text.
